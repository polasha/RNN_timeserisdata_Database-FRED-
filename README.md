# RNN_timeserisdata_Database-FRED-
#RNN for timeseries data with PyTorch>from FRED database.

##Work flow>
##Import all required libraries firstly.

## load dataset from my machine

## prepared data<> as training data and testing data

## performed the noralization for trining data due to reduce data leakage problem or better accuaracy

## Prepared data for LSTM model and define the model

## Define the loss and optimization functions

## Train the model using the training data

## Run prediction and compare to known test set

## Invert the normalization because we compare the prediction data with originnal test data

## Plot the resukt for better visulization

## Finally forecast the result for unknown data using the my train up model and observe the result through the figures.
